# Arliz

**Arliz** is a book about arrays. Not just how to use them—but how they *work*, where they come from, and why they matter.

It started as a personal attempt to understand arrays beyond syntax and surface-level use. Along the way, it turned into a written journey—from memory layouts and bounds checking, to sparse arrays, dynamic ones, and how they power everything from operating systems to physics simulations.
