### 1. **Memory Allocation Calculation for Static Arrays**

- **Description**: Given an array of integers, calculate the total memory required for storing the array. Assume that each integer occupies 4 bytes in memory. Write a program in any language (e.g., C, Python) to compute the memory requirement for an array of size $N$ where the size of the array is provided by the user.
- **Example**:
  - Input: Array size = 15
  - Output: Total memory required = 60 bytes

### 2. **Memory Representation of Python Lists and JavaScript Arrays**

- **Description**: Write a detailed comparison of how Python lists and JavaScript arrays are represented in memory. Specifically, explain:
  - How elements are stored.
  - How memory allocation is handled (i.e., contiguously or via pointers).
  - How elements of different types are stored.
- Provide a visual or pseudo-code representation of the memory layout of a mixed-type list in Python and a similar array in JavaScript.

### 3. **Dynamic Array Resizing in Python**

- **Description**: Implement a Python class that simulates the behavior of a dynamic array (like Pythonâ€™s `list`). The class should support:
  - Appending elements.
  - Automatically resizing when the array exceeds its current capacity.
  - Printing the current capacity of the array and the number of elements it holds.
  - Implement and compare the performance of resizing by copying elements into a larger array (as done in Python).
- **Challenge**: Try optimizing the resizing mechanism (e.g., doubling the size, etc.) and analyze the time complexity for different operations.

### 4. **Implementing a Static Array in C with Bounds Checking**

- **Description**: Implement a static array in C where the size is fixed at compile time. Add bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds access. The array should allow for basic operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval. Implement a simple program where the user can interactively choose operations on the array (e.g., insert an element, retrieve an element, etc.).
- **Challenge**: Implement custom error handling for out-of-bounds access and demonstrate how different types of memory issues (e.g., stack overflow, segmentation faults) might arise when bounds checking is not in place.

### 5. **Simulating Mixed-Type Arrays in a Statically Typed Language (e.g., C++)**

- **Description**: Write a program in C++ that simulates a mixed-type array by using `void*` pointers (which can point to any type). The program should:
  - Create an array where each element can hold a different type (e.g., integer, float, string).
  - Store the actual values in a struct that includes a pointer to the data and the type information (e.g., an enum representing the data type).
  - Write functions to add, remove, and display elements, ensuring type safety by checking the stored type at runtime.
- **Challenge**: Implement proper memory management (e.g., freeing memory after use) and demonstrate the trade-offs between type safety and flexibility when working with mixed-type collections in statically typed languages.
