\chapter{Real Numbers and Mathematical Completeness}
% Focus: Extending number systems to mathematical completeness

\section{Irrational Numbers: When Rationals Aren't Enough}
% Square roots, π, e - numbers that can't be expressed as fractions
% Historical discovery and mathematical necessity

\section{The Real Number Line: Geometric and Algebraic Perspectives}
% Visualizing numbers as positions, density and completeness
% Connecting to coordinate systems from Renaissance mathematics

\section{Decimal Representation and Approximation}
% How real numbers are actually represented in practice
% Foundations for understanding computational precision limits

\section{Exponents, Logarithms, and Exponential Growth}
% Powers and roots, logarithmic scales
% Essential for understanding algorithmic complexity

\section{Special Numbers and Mathematical Constants}
% π, e, φ (golden ratio) - numbers with special properties
% Their role in mathematical and computational systems
