\chapter{The Nature of Numbers and Fundamental Operations}
% Focus: From historical counting to mathematical precision

\section{What Numbers Actually Are: From Counting to Abstract Quantity}
% Natural numbers, integers, rationals - building from historical counting
% The philosophical question: what IS a number?

\section{The Fundamental Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division}
% Why these operations work, their mathematical properties
% Connecting to ancient calculation methods from Part 1

\section{Properties of Operations: Commutativity, Associativity, and Distribution}
% The mathematical laws that govern all computation
% Why these properties matter for array operations

\section{Number Systems and Positional Representation}
% Decimal, binary, and other bases - mathematical foundations
% Connecting Mesopotamian base-60 to modern positional systems

\section{Integers and the Concept of Negative Numbers}
% Historical development and mathematical properties
% Why negative numbers were controversial and how they work

\section{Rational Numbers and the Concept of Fractions}
% From Egyptian unit fractions to modern rational representation
% Mathematical properties and computational implications
