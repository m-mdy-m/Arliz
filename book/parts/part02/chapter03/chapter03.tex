% ==========================================

\chapter{Fundamental Mathematical Structures}
% Focus: Sets, relations, and the mathematical language of structure

\section{Sets and Collections: Formalizing the Concept of Groups}
% From Aristotelian categories to formal set theory
% Basic set operations and their computational significance

\section{Set Operations: Union, Intersection, Complement}
% How sets combine and relate to each other
% Connecting to Boolean logic and digital systems

\section{Relations and Mappings Between Sets}
% How mathematical objects relate to each other
% Foundations for understanding functions and data relationships

\section{Equivalence Relations and Classification}
% Mathematical formalization of "sameness" and categorization
% Essential for understanding data organization and comparison

\section{Order Relations and Systematic Comparison}
% Less than, greater than, and partial ordering
% Foundations for sorting and systematic arrangement
