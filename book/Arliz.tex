	%\maketitle
	Every book has its own story, and this book is no exception. If I were to summarize the process of creating this book in one word, that word would be “improvised.” Yet the truth is that Arliz is the result of pure, persistent curiosity that has grown in my mind for years. What you are reading now could be called a technical book, a collection of personal notes, or even a journal of unanswered questions and curiosities. But I—officially—call it a \emph{book}, because it is written not only for others but for myself, as a record of my learning journey and an effort to understand more precisely the concepts that once seemed obscure and, at times, frustrating.\\
	The story of Arliz began with a simple feeling: \textbf{curiosity}.  
	Curiosity about what an array truly is. Perhaps for many this question seems trivial, but for me this word—encountered again and again in algorithm and data structure discussions—always raised a persistent question.\\
	Every time I saw terms like \texttt{array}, \texttt{stack}, \texttt{queue}, \texttt{linked list}, \texttt{hash table}, or \texttt{heap}, I not only felt confused but sensed that something fundamental was missing. It was as if a key piece of the puzzle had been left out. The first brief, straightforward explanations I found in various sources never sufficed; they assumed you already knew exactly what an array is and why you should use it. But I was looking for the \emph{roots}. I wanted to understand from zero what an array means, how it was born, and what hidden capacities it holds.\\
	That realization led me to decide:  
	\emph{If I truly want to understand, I must start from zero.}\\	
	There is no deeper story behind the name “Arliz.” There is no hidden philosophy or special inspiration—just a random choice. I simply declared:  
	\emph{This book is called Arliz.}  
	You may pronounce it "Ar-liz," "Array-Liz," or any way you like. I personally say "ar-liz." That is all—simple and arbitrary.\\	
	But Arliz is not merely a technical book on data structures. In fact, \textbf{Arliz grows alongside me}. \\
	Whenever I learn something I deem worth writing, I add it to this book. Whenever I feel a section could be explained better or more precisely, I revise it. Whenever a new idea strikes me—an algorithm, an exercise, or even a simple diagram to clarify a structure—I incorporate it into Arliz.\\
	This means Arliz is a living project. As long as I keep learning, Arliz will remain alive.\\	
	The structure of this book has evolved around a simple belief: true understanding begins with context. That’s why Arliz doesn’t start with code or syntax, but with the origins of computation itself. We begin with the earliest tools and ideas—counting stones, the abacus, mechanical gears, and early notions of logic—long before transistors or binary digits came into play. From there, we follow the evolution of computing: from ancient methods of calculation to vacuum tubes and silicon chips, from Babbage’s Analytical Engine to the modern microprocessor. Along this journey, we discover that concepts like arrays aren’t recent inventions—they are the culmination of centuries of thought about how to structure, store, and process information.\\
	In writing this book, I have always tried to follow three principles:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Simplicity of Expression:} I strive to present concepts in the simplest form possible, so they are accessible to beginners and not superficial or tedious for experienced readers.
		\item \textbf{Concept Visualization:} I use diagrams, figures, and visual examples to explain ideas that are hard to imagine, because I believe visual understanding has great staying power.
		\item \textbf{Clear Code and Pseudocode:} Nearly every topic is accompanied by code that can be easily translated into major languages like C\texttt{++}, Java, or C\#, aiming for both clarity and practicality.
	\end{itemize}
	
	An important note: many of the algorithms in Arliz are implemented by myself. I did not copy them from elsewhere, nor are they necessarily the most optimized versions. My goal has been to understand and build them from scratch rather than memorize ready-made solutions. Therefore, some may run slower than standard implementations—or sometimes even faster. For me, the process of understanding and constructing has been more important than simply reaching the fastest result.\\	
	Finally, let me tell you a bit about myself:  
	I am \textbf{Mahdi}. If you prefer, you can call me by my alias: \emph{Genix}. I am a student of Computer Engineering (at least at the time of writing this). I grew up with computers—from simple games to typing commands in the terminal—and I have always wondered what lies behind this screen of black and green text. There is not much you need to know about me, just that I am someone who works with computers, sometimes gives them commands, and sometimes learns from them.\\	
	I hope this book will be useful for understanding concepts, beginning your learning journey, or diving deeper into data structures. \\	
	Arliz is freely available. You can access the PDF, LaTeX source, and related code at:  
	\begin{center}
		\url{https://github.com/m-mdy-m/Arliz}
	\end{center}
	In each chapter, I have included exercises and projects to aid your understanding. Please do not move on until you have completed these exercises, because true learning happens only by solving problems.\\	
	I hope this book serves you well—whether for starting out, reviewing, or simply satisfying your curiosity. And if you learn something, find an error, or have a suggestion, please let me know. As I said:
	\emph{This book grows with me.}

\chapter*{How to Read This Book}

This book is not like most technical books you've probably encountered. It doesn't start with "Here's how to declare an array" or jump straight into syntax and algorithms. Instead, Arliz takes you on a journey—a long, winding path that begins thousands of years ago with humans counting on their fingers and ends with the sophisticated data structures we use today.\\
I know what you're thinking: "Why should I care about ancient history when I just want to learn arrays?" That's a fair question, and I've asked myself the same thing many times while writing this book. Here's the thing—understanding where something comes from changes how you think about it. When you know that arrays are not just programming constructs but the culmination of humanity's age-old quest to organize information, you start to see them differently. You begin to understand not just \emph{how} they work, but \emph{why} they work the way they do.\\
Arliz is structured in seven parts, each building upon the previous one:\\
\textbf{Part 1: Philosophical \& Historical Foundations} is where we are now. This part traces the human journey from basic counting to systematic representation. We explore ancient civilizations, their counting systems, the invention of the abacus, and the gradual development of mathematical thinking that made modern computation possible. This isn't just history for history's sake—it's the conceptual foundation that makes everything else make sense.\\
\textbf{Part 2: Mathematical Fundamentals} dives into the mathematical concepts that underlie all data structures. We cover set theory, functions, mathematical logic, and discrete mathematics. If Part 1 gives you the historical context, Part 2 gives you the mathematical tools to understand why data structures work the way they do.\\
\textbf{Part 3: Data Representation} explores how information is encoded in digital systems. We look at number systems, binary representation, character encoding, and the various ways computers store and manipulate data. This is where the abstract concepts from Parts 1 and 2 start to become concrete.\\
\textbf{Part 4: Computer Architecture \& Logic} examines the hardware foundations of computation. We explore logic gates, processor architecture, memory systems, and how the physical structure of computers influences the way we organize data.\\
\textbf{Part 5: Array Odyssey} is the heart of the book. Here, we finally meet arrays in all their glory—not as mysterious programming constructs, but as the natural evolution of thousands of years of human thought about organizing information. We explore their implementation, behavior, and applications in depth.\\
\textbf{Part 6: Data Structures \& Algorithms} expands beyond arrays to explore the broader landscape of data structures. Having understood arrays thoroughly, we can now appreciate how other structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs relate to and build upon array concepts.\\
\textbf{Part 7: Parallelism \& Systems} looks at how data structures behave in complex, multi-threaded, and distributed systems. This is where we explore the cutting edge of modern computation.\\
Now, you might be wondering: "Do I really need to read all of this? Can't I just skip to the arrays part?" \\
The honest answer is: it depends on who you are and what you want to get out of this book.\\
If you're a complete beginner—someone who's never programmed before, or who's just starting to learn about computer science—then yes, I strongly recommend reading the book from beginning to end. The concepts build upon each other in a way that's designed to create a solid, unshakeable foundation for your understanding.\\
If you're an experienced programmer who just wants to deepen your understanding of arrays specifically, you could potentially start with Part 5. However, I'd encourage you to at least skim Parts 1 and 2. You might be surprised by how much the historical and mathematical context enriches your understanding of concepts you thought you already knew.\\
If you're somewhere in between—maybe you know some programming but feel like you're missing fundamental concepts—then Parts 2, 3, and 4 might be your sweet spot. You can always come back to Part 1 later when you want to understand the bigger picture.\\
For students and educators, each part serves a different pedagogical purpose. Part 1 provides historical context and motivation. Parts 2-4 build theoretical foundations. Parts 5-7 provide practical application and advanced concepts. You can use different parts for different courses or learning objectives.\\
But here's what I really want you to understand: this book is not just about consuming information. It's about building intuition. Each part includes exercises, thought experiments, and projects designed to help you internalize the concepts. Don't skip these. They're not just busy work—they're carefully designed to help you develop the kind of deep, intuitive understanding that will serve you throughout your career.\\
One more thing: as I mentioned in the preface, this book grows with me. If you find errors, have suggestions, or discover better ways to explain something, please let me know. This is a living document, and your feedback helps make it better for everyone.\\
So, whether you're here for the full journey or just part of it, welcome to Arliz. Let's explore the fascinating world of arrays together—starting from the very beginning.\\


\part{Philosophical \& Historical Foundations}

\section*{Introduction}

Long before arrays existed as data structures in programming languages—long before computers, algorithms, or even formal mathematics—humans possessed an innate drive to organize, count, and systematically represent the world around them. This part of our journey explores not just the technical evolution of computational tools, but the profound intellectual transformation of human thought about order, sequence, and structured information.\\
Arrays are not merely programming constructs. They are the culmination of humanity's oldest and most fundamental intellectual pursuit: the systematic organization of information. Their conceptual roots stretch back thousands of years, embedded in the clay tablets of Mesopotamia, the geometric patterns of ancient Egypt, the bead arrangements of the abacus, and the philosophical frameworks of classical mathematics. To truly understand arrays, we must first understand the human mind's relentless quest to impose order upon chaos, to find patterns within complexity, and to create systems that can capture, manipulate, and transform structured knowledge.\\
Our exploration begins in the prehistoric dawn of human consciousness, when our ancestors first felt compelled to count beyond their fingers, to track seasons and harvests, to record transactions and astronomical observations. We witness the birth of positional notation in ancient Mesopotamia—the revolutionary idea that the \textbf{position} of a symbol could carry meaning, laying the conceptual groundwork for array indexing. We follow the development of the abacus across civilizations, seeing how different cultures refined this early computational array, creating sophisticated systems for parallel calculation that echo modern array operations.\\
As we progress through classical antiquity, we encounter the Greek philosophers who first formalized concepts of \textbf{sets}, \textbf{sequences}, and \textbf{ordered arrangements}. Aristotle's categorical thinking, Euclid's systematic geometry, and the Pythagorean exploration of number patterns all contributed essential building blocks for understanding structured data. The Chinese mathematical tradition, with its matrix-like arrangements for solving systems of equations, demonstrates early intuitive grasp of multidimensional data organization.\\
The medieval period brings us algorithmic thinking—Al-Khwarizmi's systematic procedures, the revolutionary introduction of zero and positional notation from the Hindu-Arabic tradition, and the monastic scriptoriums that pioneered systematic knowledge organization. These developments mark the transition from intuitive arrangement to formal, reproducible methods of data manipulation.\\
The Renaissance and early modern period witness the birth of symbolic thinking—Viète's algebraic notation, Descartes' coordinate systems, Pascal's triangular arrangements of combinatorial coefficients. Each breakthrough represents a step toward the abstract, systematic representation that enables modern computational thinking. By the time we reach the threshold of mechanical computation with Pascal's calculator and Leibniz's universal symbolic aspirations, the conceptual foundations for array-based thinking are fully established.\\
This historical foundation is not mere academic curiosity. Every concept explored in later parts of this book—from basic array operations to complex algorithmic optimizations—builds upon intellectual frameworks developed across millennia. Understanding this deep history provides not just context, but genuine insight into why arrays work the way they do, why certain operations are natural while others are complex, and how the fundamental patterns of structured thinking manifest in modern computational systems.\\
When you encounter array indexing, you're participating in a tradition that began with Mesopotamian scribes arranging cuneiform symbols on clay tablets. When you manipulate matrices, you're extending methods pioneered by Chinese mathematicians over two thousand years ago. When you design data structures, you're continuing humanity's ancient quest to create order from complexity, to find systematic methods for representing and transforming information.\\
This part prepares you for the mathematical formalism of Part 2, the technical implementation details of later sections, and ultimately, for a deeper appreciation of arrays as both practical tools and profound expressions of human intellectual achievement.

\section*{How to Read}

This part is structured as a chronological journey through humanity's development of systematic thinking about information organization. Each chapter builds upon previous concepts while introducing new layers of complexity. The progression is intentionally gradual—from concrete counting methods to abstract mathematical frameworks—mirroring how human understanding evolved over millennia.\\
\textbf{For the Complete Journey:} Read chapters sequentially. This provides the full historical and conceptual foundation, showing how each civilization and era contributed essential elements to our modern understanding of structured data. Pay particular attention to recurring themes: position and place-value systems, systematic arrangement methods, symbolic representation, and the gradual abstraction from concrete tools to mathematical concepts.\\
\textbf{For Focused Study:} If you're primarily interested in specific aspects, you can emphasize certain chapters while skimming others.\\
\textbf{Connecting to Later Parts:} As you read, note how concepts introduced here reappear in mathematical formalization (Part 2), data representation (Part 3), and implementation details (Parts 4-7). The philosophical frameworks developed in early chapters provide context for technical decisions made in modern computing systems.\\
Each chapter includes timeline markers and focuses on specific conceptual developments. Don't merely read for historical facts—engage with the underlying ideas. Ask yourself: How did this development change how humans thought about organized information? What limitations did it overcome? What new possibilities did it create? This active engagement will deepen your understanding of both historical development and modern applications.

\section*{Conclusion: From Ancient Patterns to Modern Arrays}

As we conclude this journey through the historical and philosophical foundations of systematic thinking, we can see how the concept of arrays—structured, indexed collections of information—represents the culmination of humanity's oldest intellectual pursuits. From the first tally marks on bone to Leibniz's dreams of universal calculation, every development we've explored contributes essential elements to our modern understanding of structured data organization.\\
The positional notation systems of ancient Mesopotamia gave us the concept of indexed positions. The Greek philosophical frameworks provided logical foundations for classification and systematic thinking. The Islamic algorithmic revolution introduced systematic procedures for data manipulation. The Renaissance symbolic revolution enabled abstract representation of structured relationships. Each breakthrough built upon previous insights, creating the rich intellectual foundation that makes modern array-based computation both possible and natural.\\
As we move forward to Part 2's mathematical foundations, remember that every formal concept we'll encounter—from set theory to discrete mathematics—grows from the historical developments explored in these chapters. The mathematical structures that enable arrays are not arbitrary formal constructs, but the refined expression of humanity's ancient drive to create order, find patterns, and systematically organize information.\\
The journey from counting stones to manipulating multidimensional data structures is not just a story of technological progress—it's the story of human consciousness itself, reaching toward ever more sophisticated ways of representing, organizing, and transforming the structured information that surrounds us.
\part{Mathematical Fundamentals}
\section*{Introduction}

The historical journey we've completed in Part 1 brought us from humanity's first attempts at counting to the threshold of mechanical computation. We witnessed how civilizations across millennia developed increasingly sophisticated methods for organizing, representing, and manipulating structured information. Now, in Part 2, we transform this rich historical foundation into the precise mathematical language that makes modern array operations possible.\\
\\
The transition from historical intuition to mathematical formalism marks a crucial turning point in our understanding. Where ancient Mesopotamians developed base-60 positional systems through practical necessity, we now formalize the mathematical properties that make positional notation work. Where Greek philosophers contemplated the nature of categories and classification, we now develop rigorous set theory and logical frameworks. Where Islamic mathematicians created systematic procedures for solving equations, we now construct formal algorithmic foundations and discrete mathematical structures.\\
\\
This part serves as the mathematical bridge between the conceptual foundations of Part 1 and the technical implementations that follow. Every concept introduced here—from the most basic properties of numbers to the sophisticated structures of linear algebra and information theory—builds directly upon the historical developments we've traced, while simultaneously preparing the precise mathematical tools needed for understanding data representation, computer architecture, and ultimately, the elegant mathematical structures that govern array behavior.\\
\\
Our approach mirrors the historical progression we've followed, but with mathematical rigor. We begin with the most fundamental concepts—what numbers actually are, how basic operations work, and why they behave the way they do. We develop set theory not as an abstract exercise, but as the natural mathematical expression of humanity's ancient drive to classify and organize. We explore functions as the mathematical formalization of systematic relationships that ancient civilizations intuited but could not precisely express.\\
\\
As we progress through discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and linear algebra, you'll recognize echoes of historical developments: the Chinese matrix methods in our linear algebra, the Islamic algorithmic thinking in our discrete structures, the Greek geometric insights in our multidimensional representations. Each mathematical concept carries forward the intellectual achievements of the past while providing the precise tools needed for modern computational thinking.\\
\\
The mathematical structures we develop here are not arbitrary formal constructs. They represent the refined, systematic expression of patterns that humans have recognized and worked with for millennia. When we formalize the properties of mathematical operations, we're building upon the arithmetic insights of ancient calculators and merchants. When we develop set theory and Boolean algebra, we're providing rigorous foundations for the categorical thinking that has organized human knowledge since Aristotle. When we explore information theory, we're quantifying the systematic representation techniques that have evolved from Mesopotamian cuneiform to modern digital encoding.\\
\\
This mathematical foundation is essential preparation for Part 3's exploration of data representation. The number systems, logical structures, and mathematical operations we develop here directly enable the binary representation, character encoding, and digital storage methods that follow. Similarly, our exploration of discrete mathematics and combinatorics provides the analytical tools needed for understanding algorithmic complexity and optimization in later parts.\\
\\
Most importantly, this part establishes the mathematical mindset needed for truly understanding arrays. Arrays are not just programming constructs—they are mathematical objects with precise properties, behaviors, and relationships. The linear algebra we develop here directly describes multidimensional array operations. The discrete mathematics provides tools for analyzing array algorithms. The information theory quantifies the storage and transmission properties of array-based data structures.\\
\\
As we work through these mathematical concepts, remember that we're not learning abstract theory for its own sake. We're developing the precise, systematic thinking tools that make modern computation possible. Every mathematical principle we establish here will reappear in concrete, practical form as we progress through data representation, computer architecture, and array implementation. The mathematical journey we're beginning now is the essential foundation for everything that follows.

\section*{How to Read This Part}

This part is structured as a systematic progression from the most basic mathematical concepts to the sophisticated structures needed for understanding arrays and computational systems. Unlike traditional mathematics textbooks that often assume prior knowledge, we build everything from first principles, connecting each new concept to both historical foundations and future applications.\\
\textbf{Prerequisites and Assumptions:} We assume no prior mathematical knowledge beyond basic arithmetic. However, we do assume you've read Part 1 and understand the historical development of mathematical thinking. This historical context provides essential motivation and intuition for the formal concepts we develop.\\
\textbf{Progressive Structure:} Each chapter builds systematically upon previous concepts. Early chapters establish the fundamental building blocks—numbers, operations, sets, and functions. Middle chapters develop discrete mathematics and combinatorial thinking. Later chapters explore linear algebra, information theory, and the mathematical structures that directly enable array operations. This progression mirrors both historical development and logical dependency.\\
\textbf{Conceptual Integration:} As you read, actively connect new mathematical concepts to historical developments from Part 1. When we formalize set theory, remember Aristotelian categories. When we develop algorithmic analysis, recall Islamic mathematical procedures. When we explore linear algebra, connect to Chinese matrix methods. This integration deepens understanding and provides lasting intuition.\\
\textbf{Preparation for Future Parts:} Each mathematical concept introduced here has direct applications in later parts. Number theory connects to binary representation in Part 3. Boolean algebra enables digital logic in Part 4. Linear algebra provides the foundation for multidimensional arrays in Part 5. Discrete mathematics supports algorithmic analysis in Part 6. Keep these connections in mind as you progress.\\
\textbf{Practical Exercises:} Each chapter includes carefully designed exercises that build mathematical intuition and connect abstract concepts to concrete applications. These exercises are not just practice problems—they're essential for developing the mathematical thinking needed for later parts. Work through them systematically.\\
\textbf{Reading Strategies:} For complete beginners, read every chapter sequentially and work through all exercises. For those with some mathematical background, you may be able to skim familiar material, but pay attention to how concepts connect to array-based thinking. For advanced readers, focus on the unique perspectives and connections to computational applications.\\
\textbf{Mathematical Notation:} We introduce mathematical notation gradually and always provide clear explanations. Each new symbol or convention is explained when first introduced and included in the notation index for easy reference. Don't be intimidated by formal mathematical language—we build it systematically from familiar concepts.\\
The mathematical journey ahead requires patience and systematic thinking. Unlike historical narrative, mathematical development requires precise logical progression. Each concept must be thoroughly understood before moving to the next. Take time to work through examples, complete exercises, and ensure solid understanding before advancing. The mathematical foundation we build here will support everything that follows in your understanding of arrays and computational systems.

\chapter*{Conclusion: From Mathematical Foundations to Computational Reality}

As we conclude our exploration of mathematical fundamentals, we've built a comprehensive foundation that transforms the historical insights of Part 1 into the precise mathematical language needed for understanding computational systems. We've progressed from the most basic concepts—what numbers are and how operations work—through sophisticated structures like linear algebra, information theory, and formal logic.\\
Every mathematical concept we've developed here serves a dual purpose: it provides the rigorous foundation needed for understanding computational systems, while also representing the precise expression of patterns and relationships that humans have worked with throughout history. The set theory we've explored formalizes the categorical thinking that began with Aristotelian logic. The combinatorics and discrete mathematics provide systematic tools for the counting and arrangement problems that have occupied human minds since ancient times. The linear algebra gives us precise language for the multidimensional thinking that Chinese mathematicians pioneered and Renaissance artists explored through perspective.\\
Most importantly, we've developed the mathematical mindset—the systematic, precise thinking patterns that enable deep understanding of computational systems. This mathematical foundation will prove essential as we move forward to Part 3's exploration of data representation, where we'll see how mathematical abstractions become concrete digital realities.\\
The transition from mathematical foundations to data representation marks another crucial turning point in our journey toward understanding arrays. In Part 3, we'll discover how the number systems, logical structures, and mathematical operations we've developed here become the binary digits, logic gates, and computational processes that make digital systems possible. The mathematical precision we've built will enable us to understand not just how digital representation works, but why it works the way it does, and how mathematical constraints shape the possibilities and limitations of computational systems.\\
As we prepare to enter the world of bits, bytes, and digital encoding, remember that we're not leaving mathematics behind—we're applying it. Every concept in Part 3 will draw upon the mathematical foundations we've established here. The mathematical thinking we've developed will enable us to see digital representation not as arbitrary technical details, but as the natural expression of mathematical principles in physical computational systems.
