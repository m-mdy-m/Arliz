\section{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Every book has a story about its creation, and this one is no different. If I were to summarize the process of writing this book in a word, it would be \textbf{improvised}. Yet, in its essence, this book is the result of sheer curiosity. \\
It all began with a question: \textbf{What is an array?} As I delved deeper into studying data structures and algorithms, I found myself frequently encountering this concept. But I wanted more than just a functional understanding I wanted to know its origins, how it evolved, and how it works at its core. This quest for understanding led me down a rabbit hole of exploration, uncovering not only the technical details of arrays but also the fascinating history and underlying principles that make them indispensable in computing. Along the way, I uncovered not only the origins of arrays but also their profound impact on modern programming. These findings inspired me to consolidate my knowledge into a structured resource, which eventually became this book. \\
The idea to compile this book came about during a late-night discussion in the \textbf{CodeModule} group. Arrays were part of the conversation, and as I shared what I had learned, my friend Aran suggested that I write an article on the topic. The suggestion planted a seed. Within minutes, I decided to take it a step further: why not write a book? Thus, \textbf{Arliz} was born. The name itself is arbitrary chosen on a whim—but the book quickly grew into a structured effort. \\
From that moment, I started gathering information from various sources, including guidance from ChatGPT and several articles and publications on arrays. What you now hold in your hands (or view on your screen) is the result of those efforts. Throughout the writing process, I adhered to three guiding principles:  
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Simplicity and Accuracy: } Explain concepts in the simplest terms possible while ensuring a reasonable level of precision to satisfy both newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts.  
	\item  \textbf{Visualization:}  Use diagrams to clarify complex problems, making them easier to understand and recall because sometimes, a visual representation is worth more than a thousand words.  
	\item \textbf{Portability}  Include concise, well-explained pseudocode that can be easily translated into major programming languages such as C, C++, and Java. and etc.
\end{itemize}
A unique aspect of this book is its emphasis on implementation. While the theoretical underpinnings of the algorithms are grounded in established knowledge, the code and approaches presented here are largely of our own design. These implementations may differ from standard practices—occasionally for better, occasionally for worse—but they serve as a practical means of applying and internalizing the concepts discussed. 
Ultimately, the goal of \textbf{Arliz} is to deepen your understanding of arrays, empowering you to use this fundamental data structure to build efficient, effective, and elegant programs. \\
This book is freely available as a PDF or LaTeX file in the \href{https://github.com/m-mdy-m/Arliz}{Arliz repository}. It includes exercises and projects at the end of each chapter to reinforce learning. I encourage you to tackle these exercises before moving on to the next section, as they are integral to mastering the material.\\ It is my hope that this book serves as both a practical guide and a source of inspiration. May it empower you to build efficient and elegant programs, and above all, may it deepen your understanding of the power of representation in programming.

\chapter{Introduction to Arrays}
	
\section{Overview}
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science, playing a pivotal role in the organization and manipulation of data. Simply put, an array is a collection of elements, all of the same data type, arranged in a specific order and stored in contiguous memory locations. This simplicity is what makes arrays incredibly versatile—they are not just used in programming but are a concept deeply rooted in mathematics and everyday life.\\
To illustrate, imagine a multi-story building. Each floor, stacked one on top of the other, represents a single element in an array, while the entire building symbolizes the array itself. Or think of the rows and columns in a calendar—they mimic a two-dimensional array where the rows represent weeks and the columns represent days.\\
In computer science, arrays act as the backbone for more advanced data structures and algorithms. They are a starting point for understanding complex concepts like matrices, heaps, or even artificial intelligence models. Whether you’re sorting data, managing game levels, or storing large datasets, arrays provide a way to organize and access information efficiently.\\
Arrays also have a significant impact outside programming. In mathematics, arrays manifest as lists, sets, or matrices, helping solve equations and model systems. In engineering, arrays are used to simulate real-world phenomena, such as simulating airflow over a car body or rendering graphics in a video game. These real-world analogies highlight the universality of arrays, bridging the gap between abstract computation and tangible applications.\\
Why are arrays so important? It’s because they allow for direct access to elements using an index. This makes operations like reading, writing, or modifying data fast and predictable—qualities essential for performance-critical applications. From a programmer’s perspective, arrays simplify data handling, reduce memory overhead, and enable powerful algorithms like binary search or quicksort.\\
This chapter introduces you to the world of arrays, their origins, and their significance in both historical and modern contexts. By exploring their structure, purpose, and usage, you will uncover how arrays lay the foundation for efficient data storage, processing, and computation. Whether you're a beginner programmer curious about data organization or an experienced developer refining your knowledge, mastering arrays is a cornerstone of software development.\\
In the chapters that follow, we’ll delve into the history of arrays, trace their evolution in programming languages, and examine their profound influence on computer architecture. By starting with this foundational concept, you’re setting the stage for a deeper understanding of how computers work and how data flows through software systems. Let’s explore the power and elegance of arrays together!
\section{Why Use Arrays?}
As discussed in the previous section, one of the primary reasons for using arrays is their ability to provide fast access to individual elements. Imagine a 100-story building where each floor represents an element in an array. If you want to go straight to the 99th or 100th floor, you can do so instantly, just like Superman soaring directly to the top. This efficiency is a hallmark of arrays—they allow you to access any element directly by its index without needing to traverse the entire structure.\\
However, fast access is just one of the many reasons why arrays are indispensable. Arrays are not only the simplest but also the oldest data structure in computer science. Their simplicity is a significant advantage, making them easy to implement and universally supported in virtually all programming languages and systems. Whether you're working with low-level assembly code or a high-level language like Python, arrays are a fundamental feature.\\
Another compelling reason to use arrays is their speed. Arrays provide constant-time (O(1)) access to elements, making them extremely fast for read and write operations when the index is known. This efficiency has contributed to their popularity and widespread use in various computational tasks.\\
Arrays are also incredibly flexible. They can be used to represent and manipulate almost any type of data. For instance:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item The text you are reading right now is stored and displayed as an array of characters. Each letter, space, or symbol is an element in that array.
	\item Your phone or computer screen is essentially a 2D array (or matrix) of pixels. Each pixel has an (x, y) coordinate and a corresponding color value. Arrays allow computers to organize and manipulate these elements, enabling the display of text, images, and graphical interfaces.
\end{itemize}
In essence, arrays serve as the backbone for countless operations in computing, from handling raw data to building sophisticated algorithms and systems. Their combination of simplicity, speed, and versatility makes them one of the most practical and essential tools in computer science. Whether you're a novice or an experienced developer, mastering arrays is a crucial step in understanding how computers store and process information. 
\section{History}
The history and concept of arrays as a data structure are deeply embedded in the evolution of computing, tracing back to the era of the first digital computers. If the entire history of arrays were to be summarized in one sentence, it might be this: 
\begin{quote}
	\textit{"Arrays have not only shaped the way we organize and process data but have also significantly influenced—and continue to influence—the design and development of programming languages and computer architecture."}
\end{quote}
Arrays, one of the simplest yet most foundational data structures in computer science, have a rich history that intertwines with advancements in mathematics, computing, and programming languages. Born from the necessity to organize and process data efficiently, they have evolved in parallel with breakthroughs in computer architecture and software development. \\
The journey of arrays is a testament to innovation and problem-solving, reflecting their central role in shaping how we approach data storage and manipulation. From the earliest mathematical concepts to their critical role in algorithms and modern programming languages, arrays have been at the heart of data organization. Their origins, development, and widespread adoption provide a compelling glimpse into the broader progression of computing and its relentless push toward efficiency and scalability.
\subsection{Origins and Necessity of Arrays}
The concept of arrays originated from the need to manage and manipulate large volumes of data efficiently. The word "array" itself, meaning an orderly arrangement, is apt, as arrays in computing serve to organize data elements of the same type in a structured, sequential manner. The earliest inspiration for arrays comes from mathematics, where arrays functioned as vectors or matrices to perform complex mathematical operations. Mathematicians had long relied on arrays in tabular form to represent and compute large datasets. However, it wasn’t until the advent of mechanical and electromechanical computing devices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that arrays began to take on a computational form. \\ As early computing systems emerged, especially those performing repetitive or large-scale calculations, there was a clear requirement for a structure that could handle collections of similar data elements. Arrays provided a solution by offering a systematic way to store data in contiguous memory locations, enabling quick access and manipulation.\\The first practical implementations of arrays can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the advent of mechanical and electromechanical computing devices. One of the earliest forms of arrays was seen in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card}{the punch card} systems, where data was organized in a tabular format. Each row in these tables could be considered an early version of an array, with each column representing different data fields. Hollerith's punch card system, for example, allowed data to be stored in a tabular form, where rows and columns resembled the layout of a modern array. While rudimentary, this approach provided a glimpse of the systematic storage and access principles that would define arrays in computing. However, the modern conceptualization of arrays truly began to take shape with the advent of digital computers in the 1940s.
\subsection{Early Digital Computers}
During the 1940s, the first digital computers, such as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC}{ENIAC} (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) and the Harvard Mark I, were developed primarily for scientific and engineering applications. These early machines were designed to perform complex calculations, and arrays played a crucial role in organizing and manipulating data. However, the programming methods and languages used during this era were quite rudimentary compared to modern standards.\\Programming these early computers was mostly done in machine language or through plugboards (in the case of the ENIAC), where instructions were hardwired into the machine. These methods required programmers to manage arrays manually, including calculating each element's memory address and writing out explicit instructions for operations such as iteration, sorting, and searching. The task was labor-intensive, and coding errors could easily occur due to the complexity of managing data at such a low level.\\However, by the late 1940s and early 1950s, assembly language started to emerge, providing a slightly higher level of abstraction for programming. Assembly language allowed symbolic representation of machine code instructions, making it somewhat easier to work with arrays and other data structures. Even then, programmers still had to manage many of the details manually, such as addressing and looping through array elements. For example, to access the 10th element of an array, programmers needed to know the memory address of the first element and calculate the offset.  \\One notable development during this period was the creation of the EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) in 1949, which was one of the first computers to use a stored-program architecture. The EDSAC ran the first stored program on May 6, 1949, and this architecture allowed both data and instructions to be stored in the same memory. While programming was still done in assembly language, the stored-program concept laid the groundwork for more advanced programming techniques and languages that would emerge in the following decade.\\The limited memory and processing power of these early computers made arrays essential for optimizing performance. Arrays allowed programmers to store data sequentially, reducing the overhead associated with data access and manipulation, and made efficient use of the available memory. Despite the primitive programming tools, arrays were indispensable for tasks like solving systems of linear equations, performing numerical simulations, and managing large datasets in statistical computations, all of which were common in the scientific and engineering calculations for which these early machines were used.
\subsection{The Influence of John von Neumann}
A figure in the history of arrays is the renowned mathematician and computer scientist, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Computer_science}{John von Neumann}. In 1945, von Neumann made significant contributions to the development of the first stored-program computers, where both instructions and data were stored in the same memory. This innovation allowed for more flexible and powerful computational systems.\\One of von Neumann's notable achievements was the creation of the first array-sorting algorithm, known as \textbf{mergesort}. This algorithm efficiently organizes data in an array by dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together. The merge sort algorithm laid the groundwork for many subsequent sorting techniques and is still widely used today due to its optimal performance in various scenarios.\\Von Neumann’s work on merge sort and his overall contributions to computer architecture and programming set the stage for the development of high-level programming languages. These languages abstracted the complexity of managing arrays, allowing programmers to focus more on algorithmic development rather than low-level memory management.
As programming languages evolved from assembly to higher-level languages in the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of arrays became more formalized and easier to use. Languages like Fortran (1957) and COBOL (1959) introduced built-in support for arrays, enabling programmers to declare and manipulate arrays directly without concerning themselves with the underlying memory management.\\This evolution continued with languages such as C, which provided more advanced features for working with arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays and pointers, giving programmers powerful tools for managing data efficiently. Modern programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ further abstract the concept of arrays, offering dynamic array structures like lists and vectors, which automatically handle resizing and memory allocation.
\subsection{Impact on Computer Architecture}
The introduction and widespread use of arrays have significantly influenced computer architecture. Arrays demand efficient memory access patterns, leading to advancements in memory hierarchies, cache design, and data locality optimizations. Concepts like \textbf{row-major} and \textbf{column-major} ordering were developed to improve the performance of array operations, particularly for multi-dimensional arrays used in scientific and engineering applications.\\
The rise of vector processors in the 1970s and 1980s, and later, parallel computing architectures, was driven by the need to process arrays more efficiently. These systems enabled simultaneous operations on multiple array elements, dramatically accelerating tasks like matrix multiplication, image processing, and simulations.\\
\subsection{A Lasting Legacy}
From their origins in mathematical concepts to their integral role in modern computing, arrays have remained a cornerstone of data organization and processing. They continue to evolve alongside advancements in technology, adapting to new challenges like handling massive datasets in machine learning and optimizing performance for high-performance computing.\\
Arrays have not just shaped programming and algorithms; they have also influenced how we design and understand computational systems. As we move into fields like quantum computing and bioinformatics, the foundational principles of arrays remain as relevant and transformative as ever.
\section{Structure and Characteristics of Arrays}
Now that we know what arrays are and how they came to be, let’s delve deeper into their structure and explore why they are indispensable in programming. While each aspect of arrays has its own chapter for detailed discussion, we’ll summarize key points here as an introduction. Keep these ideas in mind—they'll serve as a foundation for understanding arrays as we progress through this text.\\
Arrays are more than just collections of elements. They are carefully structured data constructs, designed to optimize both performance and resource utilization. By employing a sequential memory layout, arrays enable rapid and predictable data access. This layout not only allows for efficient retrieval of elements but also ensures that operations on arrays remain consistent and manageable in terms of memory consumption.\\
Key attributes of arrays include their inherent simplicity, systematic memory arrangement, and direct access capabilities. These features make them one of the most versatile and widely used data structures across programming paradigms. Additionally, arrays provide the foundational building blocks for more complex data structures, such as matrices, tensors, and various types of lists.\\
In the chapters ahead, we will examine these characteristics in detail, along with practical examples and advanced applications. For now, consider arrays as a powerful tool in computational problem-solving, their utility stemming from a combination of elegance, efficiency, and reliability.
\subsection{Contiguous Memory Layout}
To fully appreciate the power and efficiency of arrays, it’s essential to understand how they are stored in memory. Arrays rely on a **contiguous memory layout**, meaning that their elements are stored consecutively, one after the other, in adjacent memory locations. This structural organization underpins many of the advantages that arrays offer in terms of performance and simplicity.

Let’s consider an example: an array containing four integer values: \(4, 7, 9, 13\). These values are laid out in memory sequentially, as shown in the table below:
\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Index} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{Value (default)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\\
This contiguous memory allocation has two important implications:
  
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fast Access to Elements}
	One of the most critical benefits of arrays is the ability to access any element directly in constant time, \(O(1)\). This efficiency arises because the memory address of any array element can be calculated directly using the formula:  
	\[
	{Address of element} = {Base address} + ({Index} \times {Size of each element})
	\]
	For example, assume that each integer occupies \textbf{1 unit of memory} (as in our table), and the base address of the array is \textbf{100}. To calculate the address of the third element (\(9\)) at index \(2\):
	\[
  	 {Address} = 100 + (2 \times 1) = 102
	\]
	This gives us constant-time (O(1)) access to any element in the array—super fast!
	
	\item \textbf{Efficient Cache Usage}
	The sequential arrangement of array elements in memory also leads to significant performance enhancements at the hardware level. Modern computer processors utilize \textbf{caches} to store frequently accessed data. When an element in an array is accessed, the processor often preloads several adjacent memory locations into the cache. This phenomenon, known as \textbf{spatial locality}, ensures that subsequent accesses to nearby elements (e.g., in loops or iterations) are extremely fast, as the data is likely already in the cache.\\
	The sequential arrangement of array elements in memory also leads to significant performance enhancements at the hardware level. Modern computer processors utilize \textbf{caches} to store frequently accessed data. When an element in an array is accessed, the processor often preloads several adjacent memory locations into the cache. This phenomenon, known as \textbf{spatial locality}, ensures that subsequent accesses to nearby elements (e.g., in loops or iterations) are extremely fast, as the data is likely already in the cache.\\
	
	For example, when traversing an array sequentially—say, during a summation operation:
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		sum += array[i];
	}
	\end{lstlisting}
	The contiguous layout minimizes cache misses because each element is loaded into the cache along with its neighbors. This optimization reduces the need for repeated memory accesses and accelerates the entire operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indexing: The Key to Array Access}
The concept of \textbf{indexing} is central to the functionality of arrays. An index indicates the position of an element within the array and serves as the mechanism for accessing or modifying that element. Indexing provides a simple yet powerful way to manage data in arrays, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation of elements.

\subsubsection{Zero-Based vs. One-Based Indexing}
Most modern programming languages, such as \textbf{C}, \textbf{Python}, and \textbf{Java}, adopt \textbf{zero-based indexing}. In this system, the index of the first element is \(0\), the second element is \(1\), and so on. This convention simplifies memory address calculations and aligns closely with hardware-level operations.

For example, if an array stores \(n\) elements, its indices will range from \(0\) to \(n-1\). This approach is not just a programming convenience; it stems from the way arrays are mapped to memory, where the index serves as an offset from the base memory address.

Some languages, such as \textbf{Fortran} and \textbf{MATLAB}, use \textbf{one-based indexing}, where the index of the first element is \(1\). This approach is often considered more intuitive in fields like mathematics and scientific computing, though it introduces slight additional complexity in memory address calculations.

\subsubsection{Array Declaration and Default Values}
In \textbf{C}, arrays are declared with a fixed size, and each element is assigned a default value unless explicitly initialized. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	int myArray[5];
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, the indices will be \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). By default, if the array is not explicitly initialized, all elements are set to zero. Thus, the array would be represented in memory as:
\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c}
		\hline
		\textbf{Index} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{Value (default)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0&0 \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The index allows direct access to any element in constant time, which is a major advantage of using arrays over other data structures. This provides a straightforward and efficient way to manage data, as you can quickly refer to an element by its index.
\subsection{Uniform Data Type}
A defining characteristic of arrays is that all elements within an array share the same \textbf{data type}. For instance, an array of integers exclusively stores integers, while an array of floats stores only floating-point values. This uniformity is not merely a constraint but a deliberate design choice, offering several advantages in terms of efficiency, safety, and predictability.

\subsubsection{Efficient Memory Allocation}
Since all elements in an array are of the same type, each element occupies an identical amount of memory. This uniformity allows the system to calculate memory requirements precisely and efficiently. It simplifies the process of determining the memory address of any element, as the size of each element is constant and predictable. This fixed size:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Facilitates rapid computation of offsets for indexing.
	\item  Ensures that memory can be allocated contiguously without gaps or fragmentation.
\end{itemize}
For example, in an array of integers where each integer occupies \textbf{4 bytes}, the total memory required for an array of 10 integers is simply \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bytes, allocated in a single contiguous block.
\subsubsection{Type Safety}
Enforcing a uniform data type within an array ensures \textbf{type safety}, a critical aspect of reliable programming. By restricting an array to hold only one type of data, programming errors such as incompatible type assignments or operations are prevented at compile time (in statically typed languages) or during runtime (in dynamically typed languages).\\
For instance, attempting to store a string in an array of integers will result in an immediate error in most programming languages:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	  int myArray[3] = {10, 20, "text"};  // Error: incompatible type
\end{lstlisting}
This consistency eliminates ambiguity, promotes predictable behavior, and reduces the likelihood of bugs caused by unintended type mixing.

\subsubsection{Exceptions in Certain Languages}

While traditional arrays enforce uniform data types, some languages—especially dynamic ones like \textbf{Python}—offer flexible constructs, such as lists, that allow mixed data types. However, these constructs sacrifice the efficiency and safety of true arrays for versatility. When strict uniformity and performance are required, languages like \textbf{C}, \textbf{C++}, and \textbf{Java} use arrays to maintain these properties.

For instance:

- In \textbf{Python}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	my_list = [10, "text", 3.14]  # Mixed types allowed
\end{lstlisting}

- In \textbf{C}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	int myArray[3]={10,20,30} // Uniform type enforced
\end{lstlisting}

While mixed-type collections are useful in certain scenarios, they are inherently less efficient than uniform arrays and are not suitable for performance-critical applications.\\
\textbf{But when we do something like this in Python, how is it stored in memory? And what happens behind the scenes?}\\
For example, when you define a list like this:  
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	my_list = [1, "C", "string", 3]
\end{lstlisting}
The process is fundamentally different from the contiguous memory allocation used in traditional arrays. Instead of storing elements directly in a contiguous block, Python’s list is implemented as an \textbf{array of pointers}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{List Object:} The Python list itself is stored as a contiguous block in memory, but this block contains \textbf{pointers} rather than the actual elements.
	\item  \textbf{Independent Object Storage:} Each pointer in the list points to the memory location of the respective element, which is stored as an independent Python object.
	\item  \textbf{Object Metadata:} Each Python object contains additional metadata, including type information, reference count, and value.
\end{itemize}
\\
For example, the list \texttt{[1, "C", "string", 3]} would be represented in memory as follows:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	node distance=1cm and 2cm,
	every node/.style={font=\sffamily},
	object/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=1.5cm, minimum height=0.8cm},
	pointer/.style={-stealth, thick}
	]
	
	% List object array of pointers
	\node[object] (list) {List Object};
	\node[object, right=of list] (ptr1) {ptr1};
	\node[object, right=of ptr1] (ptr2) {ptr2};
	\node[object, right=of ptr2] (ptr3) {ptr3};
	\node[object, right=of ptr3] (ptr4) {ptr4};
	
	% Element nodes
	\node[object, below=of ptr1] (obj1) {\texttt{1}};
	\node[object, below=of ptr2] (obj2) {"C"};
	\node[object, below=of ptr3] (obj3) {"string"};
	\node[object, below=of ptr4] (obj4) {\texttt{3}};
	
	% Metadata (type, ref count)
	\node[below=0.5cm of obj1, align=center] (meta1) {\textit{Type: int}\\ \textit{Value: 1}};

\subsection{Static vs. Dynamic Arrays}

Now that you understand how Python lists work behind the scenes, let’s delve into the types of arrays. In the example above, we intentionally constructed a mixed-type Python list. While it mimics array behavior, it lacks the strict type uniformity and memory efficiency of a true array. To understand the distinction, let’s compare \textbf{static} and \textbf{dynamic} arrays.

\subsubsection{Static Arrays}

A \textbf{static array} is one where the size is fixed at compile time. This means that, once declared, the array cannot grow or shrink. The number of elements it can hold must be specified when the array is created.
For example, in C:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	int myArray[10];
\end{lstlisting}
This array can hold exactly 10 integers, no more, no less. Static arrays are simple and efficient, but they lack flexibility.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Arrays}
Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink at runtime. They are super handy when you don’t know the size of the array in advance. Many modern programming languages provide built-in support for dynamic arrays:  
- Python: `list`  
- Java: `ArrayList`  
- C++: `vector`  

Here’s an example in Python:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	my_list = []
	my_list.append(5)  # Add an element
	my_list.append(10) # Add another element
	print(my_list)     # Output: [5, 10]
\end{lstlisting}
Despite the ability to resize, dynamic arrays still maintain the basic property of contiguous memory storage, similar to static arrays, which allows for efficient access and manipulation of data.
